Objective:
  Design and implementation of digital lock with a 4-bit password. 


Design aspects:
  Password set as "1101" 
  Unlock = 1 states that the lock is open after receiving the input password 1101.


Methodology:
  Designing a dital lock with 4-bit binary password having a reset button and two input numbers 0 and 1. 
  Password being set as "1101".
  
  > Creating a State Transition diagram using Moore overlapping and Moore non-overlapping model.
  > Writing the verilog codes by defining the state parameters and the various state transition blocks.
  > Final implementation of the designs by writing and executing a test bench for each model. Series of input is given in the test bench and the unlock status is checked to be set whenever the password 1101 is detected.
