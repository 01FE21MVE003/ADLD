Objectives:

1)  Design and implement a memory model for a single-port RAM with synchronous read/write.
2)  Design and implement a memory model for a single-port RAM with asynchronous read/write.
3)  Design and implement a memory model for a ROM/EPROM.
4)  Design and implement a memory model for RAM and verify the design by simulating a test bench for the same.
