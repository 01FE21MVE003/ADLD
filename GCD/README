Objectives:

1)  Design an FSM to implement GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers by repeated subtraction using datapath and control path.
2)  Verify the model by simulating a test bench for the same.


INPUT DATA GIVEN TO TEST THE MODEL:
NUMBER 1: 143
NUMBER 2: 78

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 13 (stored in register A)
