Objective:
  Design and implementation of digital lock with a 4-bit password. 


Password set as "1101" 
Unlock = 1 states that the lock is open after receiving the input password 1101.


Methodology:
  Designing a dital lock with 4-bit binary password having a reset button and two input numbers 0 and 1. 
  Password set as "1101".
  
  > Creating a State transition diagram using Moore (overlapping) model
  > Writing verilog code defining the state parameters and the state transition blocks.
  > Final implementation of the design by writing and executing a test bench. Series of input is given in the test bench and the unlock status is checked whenever the sequence 1101 is detected.
